# Tech Store Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a tech store to derive insights on sales performance across different dimensions such as time, location, and product types. The analysis is performed using Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Key Features
- Monthly sales analysis
- City-wise sales comparison
- Hourly order pattern analysis
- Product sales analysis
- Price vs. Quantity analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook Tech_Store_Sales_Analysis.ipynb.
2. Run the cells in order to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Findings
- San Francisco (CA) was the city with the highest product sales.
- The peak times for orders were around 11AM-12PM and 7PM.
- AAA Batteries were the most sold product, likely due to their widespread use in electronics and relatively low cost.
- There's an inverse relationship between product price and quantity sold for most items.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations:

- Bar chart of sales per month
- Bar chart of sales by city
- Line graph of total orders vs. time of day
- Bar chart of total number of products sold
- Dual-axis chart comparing quantity ordered and price for each product

## Analysis Highlights
### Product Sales Analysis
- AAA Batteries were the top-selling product.
- Possible reasons for high AAA Battery sales:
   1. Wide use in various electronic devices
   2. Relatively low cost compared to other products
   3. Frequent need for replacement
### Price vs. Quantity Analysis
- Created a dual-axis chart to compare the quantity ordered and price for each product.
- Observed an general inverse relationship between price and quantity sold.
- High-priced items (e.g., Macbook Pro Laptop) had lower quantities sold.
- Low-priced items (e.g., AAA Batteries) had higher quantities sold.

## Future Work
- Incorporate more advanced statistical analysis
- Add predictive modeling for future sales forecasting
- Create an interactive dashboard for real-time sales monitoring
- Analyze seasonal trends in product sales
- Investigate the impact of marketing campaigns on sales of specific products
